// Particles Javascript P5 by Matthew Thompson
// Supported via online forms and genearl online websearch

// Goal Project - Create a particle background, that have forces with eachother and stylyed like a nebula

///
To explain code functionality

It will begin to add all particles in random postion
Each particle will have a force which gathers all particles and applies forces depending on distance from each
Yes problem with this means every particle performs complex calculations but the main purpose for this project is to show my capability of implementing this and
have it readable for others

// Pre-pro - just implement first milestone = particles appear on screen and functions as expected
// Reaserch ways to view particles === One method was use html | another was base Javascript | later found p5 
//Strucutre

//Particle Config - amount/size/color

//Class particle //
  color = config colour
  x
  y
  direction x
  direction y

  //update class

  //Check if speed is greater than 0
    //Apply small accel
  
  x = direction x
  y = direction y


  // function big bang
    particles array
    for all in particles
      radis = config size
      x = random
      y = random
      direction x/y = random
      particles push(new class partcile(radius,x,y,directions)

/// Starting psuedo code
