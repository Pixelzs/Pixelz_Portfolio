                <p>About me</p>
                <p>Hi! I'm Matthew Thompson, an eager Developer in the field of Front-End Developer 
                    at Newcastle upon tyne and wear UK. 
                    Programming has been a core talent of mine since young age, obtaining skills such as
                    attention to detail, problem solving, user expereince and teamwork.
                    Since I've been exercising these skills through game development, graduated Teesside University 2023,
                    focused on Level Design as it brings great joy in piecing together all aspects of the game for the player
                    to view and expereince. After Customer service experience and in-office teamwork and agile methology, I began
                    to look back and seek to widen my range of skills to reach other industrys than game development, with the use of my core
                    skills. With this I hope to aim for a long term job commitment.

                                <p>A Personal Project made October 2023, where I wish to develop a level for players still playing and enjoying Team Fortress 2. My goal is to develop a King of the Hill level to improve my level design skills from acutal player feedback willing to test. Which 24 unqiue players have tested my development 5 times. Under break but Version alpha 6 is major development change and direction</p>

                                <p>Currently paused as career requires attention. The process involves understand Hammer Source Engine and ways to obtain Team Fortress 2 players to test the alpha map. Amazing community exists, dedicated to testing new maps submitted on
                                    their website. I have done 6 tests, each 24 player max, unqiue and gave valuable feedback in functionality of the level, and notes was it fun, was changes good or negative. Plus any exploitaions to fix to even playing field.
                                </p>

                                <p>Challenges, because of Source and TF2, the engine requires constant foresight such as adding invisible collision boxes to prevent player clipping and affecting gameplay, prevent some finding tiny lips of collision to stand on, which gives advantage not intended, class powers and their abilities greatly affecting map play. 
                                    This is overcome with careful documentation and intent to finally test and play with real players. And to recognise while classes have the potential to be dangerous if wielded optimially, average won't push it frequently to be of actual impactful trouble to the map.

                                <p>Bootcamp 2024 with INFINITY27 where I used their project as reference material and created my own level based on their story and mechanics. This was made under a month to show my skills in designing planning and implementing on my independence. </p>

                                <p>I designed this level with intent to be explorable but confind and navigable to the progression of the story. Where Wishful Thinkers is about a gem to grant wishes and the dream people reflect their corrupt nature on their wish. Influencing the player and their choice</p>

                                <p>Challenges, player navigation and progression, with how exploration gives player freedom, limits their attentiveness to continue and progress if nothing has made a change. Which my solution was having a large centre room to enter
                                    and the player needed to unlock, where rooms where split and cracks showed hints, and exploring lead to different npcs or items, rewarding the player and still showing where the end goal is.

                                <p>For Teesside Universtiry Course - Final Year Project - 69%. My made goal was to create an explorable Island with game mechanics to help traverse and look for clues to understand the objective and puzzles to solve</p>

                                <p>I greatly enjoyed this process from concept to end, and with the Unreal Engine and its tools, impressivly helped my artist touch in building mountins to what I intended this island to look. With mechanics too help explore and reach locations, this was wanting to give
                                    player the objective to simply explore and under the true objective. Inspired by Outer Wilds.

                                <p>Challenges was scale and time to implement intended gameplay features that were compressed to cover for time. This learnt me to greatly watch my hours spent and to avoid losing track on pefecting areas that aren't necessary.</p>
